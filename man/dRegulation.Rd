\title{Evaluates gene differential regulation based on manifold alignment distances.}
\usage{
dRegulation(manifoldOutput, minFC = 1.5)
}
\arguments{
\item{manifoldOutput}{A matrix. The output of the non-linear manifold alignment,  a labeled matrix with two times the number of shared genes as rows (X_ genes followed by Y_ genes in the same order) and \code{d} number of columns.}

\item{minFC}{A decimal value. Defines the cut-off threshold of fold-change to limit the testing to genes that show, at least \code{minFC} deviation.}
}
\value{
A data frame with 5 columns as follows: \itemize{
\item \code{gene} A character vector with the gene id identified from the \code{manifoldAlignment} output.
\item \code{distance} A numeric vector of the Euclidean distance computed between the coordinates of the same gene in both conditions.
\item \code{Z} A numeric vector of the Z-scores computed after Box-Cox power transformation.
\item \code{FC} A numeric vector of the FC computed with respect to the expectation.
\item \code{p.value} A numeric vector of the p-values associated to the fold-changes, probabilities are asigned as \eqn{P[X > x]} using the Chi-square distribution with one degree of freedom.
\item \code{p.adj} A numeric vector of adjusted p-values using Benjamini & Hochberg (1995) FDR correction.
}
}
\description{
Using the output of the non-linear manifold alignment, this function computes the Euclidean distance between the coordinates for the same gene in both conditions. Calculated distances are then transformed using Box-Cox power transformation, and standardized to ensure normality. P-values are assigned following the chi-square distribution over the fold-change of the squared distance computed with respect to the expectation.
